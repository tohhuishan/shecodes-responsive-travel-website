              <h3>Singapore is a City in Nature</h3>
              <p>
                To combat this decline in natural space, the government
                introduced the vision of making Singapore a "Garden City" after
                its independence, aiming to improve quality of life. Since then,
                nearly 10% of Singapore's land has been set aside for parks and
                nature reserves. Singapore's well known gardens include the
                Singapore Botanic Gardens, a 164-year-old (as of 2023) tropical
                garden and Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site.

              <h3>Singapore has Rich Cultural Heritage</h3>
              <p>
                Despite its small size, Singapore has a diversity of languages,
                religions, and cultures. Racial and religious harmony is
                regarded as a crucial part of Singapore's success, and played a
                part in building a Singaporean identity. As such, citizens with
                different ethnicities can exercise the freedom to practise their
                racial and religious activities.

              <h3>Singapore is a Food Haven</h3>
              <p>
                Local foodstuff generally relate to a particular ethnicity -
                Chinese, Malay and Indian; but the diversity of cuisine has
                increased further by the hybridisation of different styles, such
                as the Peranakan cuisine, a mix of Chinese and Malay cuisine.
                The hawker culture in Singapore was successfully inscribed as
                Singapore's first element on the UNESCO Representative List of
                the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity on 16 December
                2020.

                located at the mouth of the Singapore River, it was built by
                local craftsman Lim Nang Seng, designed by Kwan Sai Kheong, and
                unveiled on 15 September 1972 by then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan
                Yew.
